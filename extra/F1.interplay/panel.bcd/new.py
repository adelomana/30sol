transcripts upregulated but have higher footprints than expected, are they at low abundance?


define on the fc figure, the deviation from PIs.
Then for those who are upreguated, those that have greater changes in



###

either, run PI with all and then find if tc plus footprints have lower exp than tc plus all

or
get the names of tc plus
get the names of high or low footprints
are low and high different levels of exp???


### This script tests the question: what is the transcript abundance difference in TP1 between transcripts with more or less footprints than expected among the upregulated transcripts?

# retrieve upregulated transcripts

# associate up, neutral or down for footprints

# make a figure with three histograms and run a hypothesis test


# build a figure that shows expression of upregulated genes into three groups: consistent footprints up, neutral or down
# check first in TP1, then cosistently across all TPs
print(DETs['tp.4'].keys())
